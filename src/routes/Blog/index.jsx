                Tech Startup Club has successfully launched, I had multiple interviews (and failed them 😭), met TONS of new exciting people, and learned new technologies and skills along the way.  
    
                Thanks a MILLION to all of my founding members, it's definitely been a journey and you've had my back the whole time through, even when it seemed like I didn't know what I was doing (which I don't). 😁  
    
                Thank you to Nicholas Jordan, Jacob Klymenko, Preston Sia, Primitivo Bambao IV, Anthony Naydyuk, Alex Yu, Fernando Olivar Neri, Luke Willis, Nikita Bizyuk, Austin Nguyen, Linda Miao, John Diego, those who come infrequently ... and to the chair for taking our group photo! 😂  
    
                Here's to the Future! 🚀🥂
